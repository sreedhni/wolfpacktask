4)Create Superuser (Optional):
If you want to access the Django admin panel, create a superuser:

python manage.py createsuperuser

5) Run Development Server:
Start the Django development server:

python manage.py runserver

6)Access APIs:
You can now access the REST APIs for user registration and login at the specified endpoints. Make sure to check the documentation or code comments for the API endpoints.
